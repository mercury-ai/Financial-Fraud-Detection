# Financial-Fraud-Detection

A machine learning model trained on the <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1>PaySim synthetic dataset</a> to detect fraudulent transactions.
<p> On data analysis, I found out that the <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1>PaySim synthetic dataset</a> is highy undalanced (99.95:0.05 ratio), and impossible to train on to achieve the desired performance. So, I created a new balanced dataset through data sampling in such that the final dataset has a 1:1 ratio of fraud and safe transactions. This ML model is trained on the new dataset that I created through random sampling, and I highly recommend anyone working with this dataset to do data sampling before training the ML model.<p>
<br><p>Check out the complete notebook (including data sampling) on kaggle <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/harigovindv10/notebook97d76df009'>here</a>.    
<br><p> This is my first proper Machine Learning project, and is open to criticism. Cheers :)
